1. Introduction
ResNetVision is an intelligent computer vision engine built using deep learning techniques. It uses a Residual Network (ResNet) architecture to improve image recognition and analysis. This project is designed for industrial applications, such as quality control and real-time monitoring.

2. Key Definitions
Deep Learning: A method of teaching computers to learn from large amounts of data using neural networks.

Residual Network (ResNet): A type of deep learning architecture that uses shortcut connections to help train very deep models without performance issues.

Intelligent Vision Engine: A system that processes and interprets visual data automatically.

High-Performance Computing: Using powerful computing resources to train and run complex models quickly.

3. Problem Statement
Industries need a vision system that can:

Handle complex images with high accuracy.

Work in real-time for tasks like monitoring and quality control.

Scale easily for different applications without losing performance.

Traditional vision systems often struggle with these requirements, leading to inefficiencies and errors.

4. Proposed Solution
ResNetVision tackles these challenges by:

Using ResNet Architecture: This helps the model learn better and deeper without common issues like vanishing gradients.
